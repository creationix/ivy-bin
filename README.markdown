This small repo contains the node binaries for the Ivy node distribution.

The repo is tagged to match node versions.  It's intended to be used as a submodule in the [Ivy][] distribution.

The two binaries included right now are:

 - node-osx - 64 bit node compiled on Snow Leopard. Links to openssl that comes with Snow Leopard
 - node-linux - 32 bit compiled on Ubuntu 10.4. Links to openssl 0.9.8

I want to eventually add more, but these two are the platforms I use daily and are easy for me to maintain and test.
